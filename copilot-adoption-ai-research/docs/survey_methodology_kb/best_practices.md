# Survey Question Best Practices (starter KB)

## Avoid bias / leading language
- Avoid emotionally loaded words (e.g., “amazing”, “terrible”).
- Avoid presuppositions (e.g., “How much did Copilot improve your work?” assumes improvement).

## Avoid double-barreled questions
- Don’t ask two things at once (“useful and easy”).

## Clarity and specificity
- Define timeframe (e.g., “in the past 30 days”).
- Avoid vague quantifiers (“often”, “regularly”) without anchors.

## Response scales
- Use consistent direction and label endpoints.
- Prefer 5- or 7-point Likert for attitudes.
- Ensure “Not applicable” where appropriate.

## Cognitive load
- Keep questions short and single-concept.
- Avoid negatives and double negatives.
